This directory includes code for detecting people and objects and extracting attributes using poselets.

BUILD/RUN INSTRUCTIONS

The project is available on UNIX (gcc). There is a Matlab MEX file provided as well.

1. Download the Boost libraries from www.boost.com. You do not need to compile them for this project.
2. If needed, install the JPEG library.
3. If needed, install OpenMP.
4. Modify the build file to provide the location of your boost and (if needed, Matlab) path and to remove -fopenmp if not using OpenMP.
5. Build with "make test". This will compile a poselets lib and the test project
6. Run the test file by specifying the classifier XML and the image file. For example:
  poselets_test/poselets_test data/categories/person.xml poselets_test/test_image.jpg
This should load an image, run poselets and report the number of detected people. On Windows, you can enable drawing the test image and bounding boxes by changing poselets_test/main.cpp

BUILDING MEX FILES

To build a MEX file, uncomment the MATLAB location from inside the Makefile and do the following commands:

make clean
make test
make

The mex file should appear in the root directory.
Run it without arguments from Matlab to see help on how to use it
