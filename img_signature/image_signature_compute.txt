cSalMap = idct2(sign(dct2(img))).^2;

idct2, sign, dct2 are all matlab functions

IDCT2 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform.
    B = IDCT2(A) returns the two-dimensional inverse discrete
    cosine transform of A.

SIGN   Signum function.
    For each element of X, SIGN(X) returns 1 if the element
    is greater than zero, 0 if it equals zero and -1 if it is
    less than zero.  For the nonzero elements of complex X,
    SIGN(X) = X ./ ABS(X).

DCT2 2-D discrete cosine transform.
    B = DCT2(A) returns the discrete cosine transform of A.
    The matrix B is the same size as A and contains the
    discrete cosine transform coefficients.
